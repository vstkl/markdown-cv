## Summary

I am a fullstack developer with overlaps in many areas, including automation, cybersecurity, embedded systems, and anything that catches my interest. This comes from a fascination with electrical engineering since I was 10, and it hasn't left so far. I am an experienced Python and JS developer, as it is most comfortable to use this combination for rapid and agile development. Learning that good DevOps is a critical part of any teamwork was one of the most important lessons I got as an engineer. It is also important to me to have a good relationship with the team and colleagues, even from other departments close to me, either project-wise or near my office. I have also peeked into the world of cybersecurity, and after a year, I still have to call myself a beginner, since I am just learning how many things I don't know, therefore being humble is in place regarding this matter. For whatever reason, I became a heavy VIM user, probably because of its availability on pretty much every *nix-based computer.
